Gen AI Basics
     1. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to models that can create new content—such as text, images, audio, video, or code—based on patterns learned from data.
Unlike traditional AI that only classifies or predicts, generative models produce original outputs that resemble human creativity.
Examples include ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Gemini.

Generative AI works using deep learning architectures like Transformers, VAEs, and GANs. These models learn the structure of data and generate new samples that feel realistic.
It is widely used in content creation, code generation, design, research assistance, and enterprise automation.

2. What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.
ML models improve their performance through experience, making them ideal for tasks like prediction, classification, recommendation, and anomaly detection.

Common ML types include:

Supervised Learning – learns from labeled data

Unsupervised Learning – finds patterns without labels

Reinforcement Learning – learns through rewards and penalties

ML powers applications like fraud detection, recommendation engines, self-driving cars, diagnostic systems, and more.

 3. What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning (DL) uses multi-layered neural networks to learn high-level features automatically from raw data.
It excels in complex tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.

Deep learning networks like CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers can identify patterns that are too subtle or multi-dimensional for traditional ML models.
This makes DL the backbone of modern AI systems.

 4. What is Vector Embedding?

Embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or audio that capture meaning in a form a machine can understand.
They place similar items closer in vector space, enabling tasks like semantic search, document clustering, sentiment analysis, and recommendation.

Modern embedding models capture context, relationships, and semantics, allowing AI systems to understand meaning rather than just keywords.

 5. What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of training a pre-trained model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset to specialize it.
It helps adapt general-purpose models to specific tasks such as legal QA, medical diagnostics, coding help, or customer support.

Fine-tuning improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and aligns model behavior with the target domain.
